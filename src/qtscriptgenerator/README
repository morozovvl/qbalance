Qt Script Generator labs package, version 0.2


The Qt Script Generator is a tool that generates Qt bindings for Qt Script.

---

Instructions:

1) Build the generator: cd path/to/this/project/generator, qmake && make

2) Run the generator (without arguments)
   This will generate C++ files in path/to/this/project/generated_cpp
   and documentation in path/to/this/project/doc

3) Build the bindings plugins: cd path/to/this/project/qtbindings, qmake && make
   The plugins will be put under path/to/this/project/plugins

4) To use the plugins in your application, add the plugins path to the library paths
   (QCoreApplication::setLibraryPaths()), then call QScriptEngine::importExtension()
   (plugin keys are "qt.core", "qt.gui", etc).

There is a simple script interpreter / launcher in path/to/this/project/qtbindings/qs_eval
that imports all the bindings. You can use it to run the examples found in
path/to/this/project/examples. E.g., with the examples directory being the working directory:

../qtbindings/qs_eval/qs_eval CollidingMice.js


See the generated doc/index.html for more information.

Have fun!
